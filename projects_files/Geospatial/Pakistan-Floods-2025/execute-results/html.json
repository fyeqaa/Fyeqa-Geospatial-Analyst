These floods caused extensive damage to lives, infrastructure, agriculture, and the economy, affecting millions.\n\nAccurate and timely flood mapping is critical for disaster response, resource allocation, and recovery planning.\n\nThis project uses **Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)** data to detect floodwaters in Punjab by analyzing radar backscatter differences between pre-flood and during-flood periods. SAR is especially useful as it can penetrate cloud cover and is unaffected by daylight, providing reliable flood information in all weather conditions.\n\n#### Objectives:\n\n- Detect flood-affected areas in Punjab during a key flood event using radar backscatter thresholding.\n- Compare water extent before and during the flood to assess the scale of inundation.\n- Provide clear, interactive visualizations with side-by-side maps for easy comparison.\n- Create a reproducible Google Earth Engine workflow adaptable for future flood events in Pakistan or similar regions.\n\nBy delivering near-real-time spatial flood information, this work aims to support faster, informed decisions in disaster management and help reduce human and economic losses.\n\n\n#### Data Sources\n- **Sensor**: Sentinel-1 (C-band Synthetic Aperture Radar)  \n- **Product**: `COPERNICUS/S1_GRD`  \n- **Polarization**: VV  \n- **Mode**: Interferometric Wide Swath (IW)  \n- **Resolution**: ~10 meters  \n\n#### Time Periods\n\n| Period       | Date Range             | Purpose               |\n|--------------|------------------------|------------------------|\n| Pre-Flood    | 2025-06-01 to 2025-06-10 | Baseline water extent |\n| During Flood | 2025-08-21 to 2025-09-08 | Flood analysis        |\n\n\n#### Methodology\n\n1. **Filter Sentinel-1 imagery** for Punjab for specified dates.\n2. Compute the **median VV polarization image** for each period.\n3. Apply a **backscatter threshold** of **-19.5 dB** to identify water-covered areas.\n\n#### Outputs\n\n**Left Map**: Pre-flood water extent (blue)\n**Right Map**: Flood water extent (red)\n![Flood Map](../images/Pak_floods.png)\n",
