# ContriBOT â€” Author Contribution and Acknowledgement Extraction

## Overview

This project was developed in collaboration with the **BIH QUEST Center for Responsible Research** as part of my work on text mining and scientific metadata extraction.

**ContriBOT** is an R package designed to automatically detect and extract Author Contribution statements, Acknowledgements, and ORCID mentions from scientific publications. It uses advanced PDF-to-text conversion and natural language processing techniques to parse scientific articles and categorize author contributions based on the CRediT taxonomy.

This tool supports research transparency and helps streamline metadata analysis across large publication sets.
