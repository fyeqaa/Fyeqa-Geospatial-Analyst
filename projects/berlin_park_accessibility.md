Community Park Accessibility Analysis in Berlin
Problem Definition
Main Question:
How are community parks accessible to residents across Berlin’s districts?
Project Goal:
Evaluate the spatial distribution of parks relative to population density and analyze park accessibility to identify areas underserved by green spaces, supporting equitable urban planning.

Analysis Overview
1. Population and Park Data Integration
•	Research Question:
What is the population size per district, and how many parks are located within each district?
•	Goal:
Merge demographic data with spatial boundaries and park locations to prepare for accessibility analysis.

2. Park Counts per District
•	Research Question:
How many parks are there in each Berlin district?
•	Goal:
Quantify park availability across districts to identify disparities in green space distribution.
