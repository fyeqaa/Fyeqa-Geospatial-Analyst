#### Project Overview

In this project, I explored the **soil–vegetation–atmosphere continuum** in Sialkot using satellite time series data from **2015 to 2024**. It focuses on assessing the **relationship between water content in soil vegetation atmosphere**.


#### Data Sources

-  **NDVI** – MODIS/061/MOD13Q1 (Vegetation)
-  **Soil Moisture** – SMAP SPL4SMGP (Soil Moisture content)
- ️ **Precipitation** – CHIRPS Daily

#### Methodology

- **Trend Analysis** of NDVI and Soil Moisture (2015–2024)
- **Correlation Analysis** between vegetation and climate variables
- **Seasonal Pattern Extraction** from 10 years of time series


## Key Insights
It can be observed that precipitation increases soil moisture, which in turn leads to higher NDVI values. This relationship is further supported by the correlation matrix, which shows positive correlations between precipitation and soil moisture, and between soil moisture and NDVI.
