Results are presented through interactive maps and a detailed summary report, providing actionable insights to support equitable urban planning in Berlin.\n\n\nKey Findings\n\nDistricts like Spandau and Marzahn-Hellersdorf offer abundant park area per capita, densely populated areas such as Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg have limited green space.\nNearly 38% of sub-districts lack any parks, revealing significant spatial disparities.\nThese findings emphasize the need for targeted urban planning to promote equitable access to green spaces across Berlin.It highlights spatial inequalities in green space availability and park access.
